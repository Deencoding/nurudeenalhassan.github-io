										<p>Mint Classics Company, a distinguished retailer specializing in classic model cars and vehicles, is contemplating the closure of one of its storage facilities. Tasked with providing data-driven recommendations for reorganizing or downsizing inventory while upholding prompt customer service, my role as a data analyst involved leveraging MySQL Workbench to gain insights into the business operations.
